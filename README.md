ConvertGridToDatabase
==========================================
Copyright 2021 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. All rights reserved worldwide.

This script lets you select domains or connectors and have them 
converted into database surface or curves, respectively, while keeping
the original grid entities intact.

1. Connectors are converted to database curves of polynomial degree 1.
2. Structured domains are converted to database surfaces of polynomial degree 1. You may optionally have the surface splined to degree 3.
3. Unstructured domains are converted to shell entities.
